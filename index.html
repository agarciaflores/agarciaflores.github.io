                    MathWise Insititute is designed to help people around the world develop a strong understanding for a variety of mathematical
                    subjects. Each course goes through the material that would typically be covered in a university environment, and more! The primary
                    goal is for you, the reader, to be able to learn at your own pace. A lesson plan can be found when clicking on any of the available
                    courses. At the end of each lesson, a problem set will be assigned in order to test what's
                    been leaned. The problem sets will be split up into three sections: easy, moderate, and challenging. The goal is to build confidence
                    before facing a challenging problem. A file with the problem set solutions will also be available at the end of each lesson, should it
                    be necessary. Explore the courses and have fun growing your mathematical mind, we hope you enjoy!
