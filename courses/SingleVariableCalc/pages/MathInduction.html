            <b>Mathematical Induction</b>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Mathematical induction is a powerful proof technique used to prove mathematical statements.
                    Most calculus courses do not require or even cover the topic, however it is needed to solve
                    some of the problems in our problem sets. Additionally, students are expected to know 
                    mathematical induction at most Ivy League schools, so we figured it would be best to put
                    anyone using our resources at that caliber.
                    <br><br>
                    Mathematical induction is a very procedural concept. The steps are as follows:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Define your statement</li>
                        <li>Prove the 'Basis Step' (a.k.a. 'Base Case' or 'Basis Case')</li>
                        <li>'Inductive Step'</li>
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>Assume the statement is true for \(k\) (this is your "Inductive Hypothesis")</li>
                            <li>Prove the statement for \(k+1\) using the Inductive Hypothesis</li>
                        </ol>
                        <li>"By mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for..."</li>
                    </ol>
                    This is what the process typically looks like:
                    <ol>
                        <li>For all positive integers \(n\), let \(P(n)\) be the statement</li>
                        \[\text{*Math statement here.*}\]
                        <li>Basis step: \(n=1\)</li>
                        \[\text{*Math proof here*}\]
                        <li>Inductive step: Assume that \(P(k)\) is true for some positive integer \(k\), i.e.,</li>
                        \[\text{Rewrite math statement here, replacing n with k}\]
                        \[\text{(Inductive Hypothesis)}\]
                        <li>We show that \(P(k+1)\) is true, i.e.,</li>
                        \[\text{Proof here, using inductive hypothesis}\]
                        <li>By mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all positive integers \(n\).</li>
                    </ol>
                    The statement \(P(n)\) is the statement that you seek to prove. Said statement may only be true
                    for integers greater than \(3\), or only even integers, or maybe only negative integers, it should
                    be mentioned what values the statement is true for. In the example above we wrote "all positive
                    integers \(n\)." 
                    <br><br>
                    The basis step proves the statement for the first \(n\) value. In the case of 
                    all positive integers, we start with \(n=1\) since \(1\) is the first positive integer. Why is the
                    basis step necessary? It shows that the statement \(P(x)\) starts off as true, and thus we are proving
                    that it <i>continues</i> to be true. A typical analogy made here is that of a row of dominos: you can't
                    prove that the last domino falls if the very first domino <u>doesn't</u> fall.
                    <br><br>
                    The inductive step introduces the inductive hypothesis. The hypothesis revolves around the statement \(P\)
                    being true for <u>some</u> integer \(k\) [the use of the word "some" is crucial, it is not "all", just some particular
                    value of \(k\), this way \(k\) can take any arbitrary value that fits within the conditions of \(n\)].
                    <br><br>
                    After assuming \(P(k)\) is true, we prove it is true for the following integer value, \(k+1\). Going back
                    to the domino analogy, if we assume the \(5^{\text{th}}\) domino falls we can prove that \(6^{\text{th}}\) domino must also fall.
                    Thus we must use our assumption of \(P(k)\) to prove \(P(k+1)\), this is where we use the inductive hypothesis to
                    prove \(P(k+1)\). Remember, the inductive hypothesis <u>must</u> be used, no exceptions.
                    <br><br>
                    Lastly, one must write the statement "By mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all..." finishing it off by 
                    explaining the conditions for \(n\).
                    <br><br>
                    [If you ask a mathematician, they will say that it is not a valid proof if one uses both sides of the equation to prove the statement.
                    If you ask anyone else, they will say make your life easier and use both sides to prove the statement. Unfortunately, we side with the
                    mathematician. All proofs done using mathematical induction going forward will be done using only one side of the equation. Though it is
                    more challenging, we do believe it is the best way to do proofs. Thus, we identify which side we are focusing on and manipulate it until
                    we get it to exactly match the other side of the equation. See the solution to the example below.]
                    <br><br>
                    <b><u>Example:</u></b> Use mathematical induction to prove that
                    \[
                        1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2n+1)^2 = \frac{(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)}{3}
                    \]
                    for all nonnegative integers \(n\).
                    <br><br>
                    <button id="button1" class="solutionButton">\(\rightarrow\) Solution</button>
                    <div id="text1" class="slideout">
                        For \(n&ge;0\) (all nonnegative integers \(n\)), let \(P(n)\) be the statement

                            \text{"}1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2n+1)^2 = \frac{(n+1)(2n+1)(2n+3)}{3}\text{."}
                        \]
                        Basis step: Left-hand side: \((2(0)+1)^2=1\); right-hand side: \(\frac{(0+1)(2(0)+1)(2(0)+3)}{3}=\frac{3}{3}=1\). Thus \(P(0)\) is true.
                        <br><br>
                        Inductive Step: Assume that \(P(k)\) is true for some nonnegative integer \(k\), i.e.,
                        \[

                        \]
                        We show that \(P(k+1)\) is true, i.e.,
                        \[
                            1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2k+1)^2+(2(k+1)+1)^2 = \frac{((k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+1)(2(k+1)+3)}{3},
                        \]
                        which simplifies to:
                        \[
                            1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2k+1)^2+(2k+3)^2 = \frac{(k+2)(2k+3)(2k+5)}{3}.
                        \]
                        Left-hand side:
                        \[
                            \begin{align*}
                            1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2k+1)^2+(2k+3)^2 &= \left[1^2+3^2+5^2+...+(2k+1)^2\right]+(2k+3)^2 \\
                            &= \frac{(k+1)(2k+1)(2k+3)}{3}+(2k+3)^2 \\
                            & \text{(by inductive hypothesis)} \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{(k+1)(2k+1)}{3}+(2k+3)\right) \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{(k+1)(2k+1)}{3}+\frac{6k}{3}+\frac{9}{3})\right) \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{(k+1)(2k+1)+6k+9}{3}\right) \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{(2k^2+k+2k+1)+6k+9}{3}\right) \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{2k^2+9k+10}{3}\right) \\
                            &= (2k+3)\left(\frac{(2k+5)(k+2))}{3}\right) \\
                            &= \frac{(k+2)(2k+3)(2k+5)}{3} \text{ (right-hand side).} 
                            \end{align*}
                        \]
                        By mathematical induction, \(P(n)\) is true for all nonnegative integers \(n\).

                    <br>
                    There is another proof technique, called <b>strong induction</b>, that is basically mathematical induction but it proves the statement
                    for all integer values <i>up to</i> \(k\) and \(k+1\). Thus, the inductive hypothesis assumes that the statement is true for \(P(n)\),
                    \(P(n+1)\),...,\(P(k)\). However, strong induction is not anticipated in this course and therfore will not be covered. Below are
                    additional resources on mathematical induction and strong induction.
