            <h3>Lesson 1: Functions and Limits</h3>
            <b>Limit of a Function</b>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The study of calculus revolves around the concept of a <b>limit</b> of a function.
                    The limit of a function is the value the function approaches as the input value, \(x\),
                    approaches a designated value. The notation of a limit generally looks like the following:
                    <br>
                    \[\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)=\beta\]
                    and is said "the limit of \(f(x)\), as \(x\) approaches \(\alpha\), is equal to \(\beta\)."
                    The strict and precise definition of a limit is that <i>if \(\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x) = \beta\)
                    then for any number \(\epsilon\) however small, it must be possible to find a number \(\omega\)
                    such that \(\lvert f(x)-\beta\rvert&lt;\epsilon\) whenever \(\lvert x-\alpha\rvert&lt;\omega\)</i>.
                    In other words, the values of \(f(x)\) tend to get closer to \(\beta\) as \(x\) gets closer to the
                    value \(\alpha\) (from either side of \(\alpha\)), however, \(x\neq\alpha\) and by extension \(\omega\neq 0\).
                    <br><br>
                    To get a better understanding of a limit, let's investigate the behavior of the function \(p\)
                    defined by \(p(x)=(x-3)^3+2\) for values of \(x\) near \(3\):
                    <br><br>
                    <img id="invert" class="table" src="../figures/Limits_Table1.png" alt="A table of x and y values used to recognize a pattern for limits">
                    <br>
                    The table shows the values of \(x\) approaching \(3\) from the left and values approaching from the right.
                    We see that when \(x\) is close to \(3\), on either side of \(3\), \(p(x)\) approaches 2. Thus,
                    the limit of \(p(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(3\) is equal to \(2\). On a graph, this is what we're generally
                    looking at:
                    <br><br>
                    <img class="figure" src="../figures/Limits_Figure1.png" alt="Graph of the function p(x), showing the limit as x approaches 3.">
                    <br>
                    In many cases, the limit of the function as \(x\) approaches \(\alpha\) will simply be the value \(f(\alpha)\), but
                    this is not always true. Take, for example, the following function,
                    <br>
                    \[f(x) = \frac{x}{\sin(x)},\]
                    the function takes the value of \(\frac{0}{0}\) when \(x=0\), an undefined result. Yet, if we look at the graph of the function
                    \(f(x)\) below,
                    <br>
                    <img class="figure" src="../figures/Limits_Figure2.png" alt="Graph of the function f(x), showing the limit as x approaches 0.">
                    we see that the limit of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(0\) is equal to \(1\).
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, we find that if the function is undefined at \(x=\alpha\), the limit of the
                    function as \(x\) approaches \(\alpha\) will not be equal to the value of \(f(x)\).
                    Additionally, even if the function is defined at \(x=\alpha\), a discontinuous function will
                    also lead to inconsistencies at a point of discontinuity. [This is dicussed further in the next section].
                    <br><br>
                    Before we look at an example of a discontinuous function, let's go over a bit of new notation:
                    \[
                        \begin{gather*}
                            \lim_{x\to\alpha^+} f(x)=\beta_1 \text{ (right-hand limit)}, \\
                            \lim_{x\to\alpha^-} f(x)=\beta_2 \text{ (left-hand limit)},
                        \end{gather*}
                    \]
                    where \(\beta_1\) may or may not be equal to \(\beta_2\). The difference between these expressions
                    and the notation from the beginning of the section is that the value \(x\) is approaching, \(\alpha\),
                    now has a \(+\) or \(-\) as an exponent. All this is telling us is which direction we are approaching
                    the value \(\alpha\) from. When the limit has a \(+\) that indicates that we are only looking for the
                    value as we approach from the right hand side, i.e. \(x&gt;\alpha\), and when the limit has a \(-\) it means we are only looking
                    as we approach only from the left hand side, i.e. \(x&lt;\alpha\). So, whereas before we would be looking from both sides of the
                    \(x\) value, we are now only considering one.
                    <br><br>
                    Before continuing on to an example, we feel it is important to reiterate these main points:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            The value of \(\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)\) depends on the values of \(f(x)\) for \(x\) near \(\alpha\), not for \(x\) equal to \(\alpha\).
                            Even if \(f(\alpha)\) is defined, it can be changed without having any influence on the value of the limit.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If as \(x\) approaches \(\alpha\) the values of \(f(x)\) do not approach any fixed value, we say that \(f(x)\) has no limit as \(x\to\alpha\),
                            or that \(\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)\) does not exist.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            When evaluating \(\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)\) we consider values of \(x\) on both side of \(\alpha\).
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <b><u>Example:</u></b> Let's evaluate the graph of the piecewise function \(m\), defined by
                    \[
                        \begin{gather*}
                            m(x) = \left\{
                                \begin{array}{11}
                                    4\sin(x-3) & x&lt;3 \\
                                    4 & x=3 \\
                                    (x-3)^2-4 & x&gt;3 
                                \end{array}
                                \right.
                        \end{gather*}
                    \]
                    <img class="figure" src="../figures/Limits_Figure3.png" alt="A graph of the function m(x).">
                    <br>
                    [\(m\) being a <b>piecewise function</b> simply means that it is defined by more than one sub-function, where each
                    sub-function only applies to a particular, unique interval of the domain. The first sub-function of \(m\) is graphed
                    in red, the second in green, and the third in blue. In this case, the second sub-function is simply the point \((3,4)\).]
                    <br><br>
                    Find the following information using the graph and definition of \(m(x)\):
                    <br>
                    \(
                        \begin{align*}
                                & \text{a. } m(3) \\
                                & \text{b. } \lim_{x\to 3^-} m(x) \\
                                & \text{c. } \lim_{x\to 3^+} m(x) \\
                                & \text{d. } \lim_{x\to 3} m(x)
                        \end{align*}
                    \)
                    <br><br>
                    <button id="button1" class="solutionButton">\(\rightarrow\) Solution</button>
                    <div id="text1" class="slideout">
                        \(\text{a. }\) To evaluate \(m(3)\), we must look at the \(x\) value of \(3\) on the graph and look for the resulting output value,
                        in this case \(4\) (as seen from the green point on the graph). Thus, \(m(3)=4\).
                        <br><br>
                        \(\text{b. }\) Since the limit has a negative exponent on the \(3\), that means we are looking for the limit as \(x\) approaches
                        \(3\) from the left. Looking at the graph, this would be the red curve. Thus, the limit of \(m(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(3\) from the
                        left is equal to \(0\). We can express this as the following:
                        \[
                            \begin{gather*}
                                \lim_{x\to 3^-} m(x) = \lim_{x\to 3} \left[4\sin(x-3)\right] = 0.
                            \end{gather*}
                        \]
                        Notice that since we were approaching \(3\) from the left, we were only looking at the first sub-function of \(m(x)\), \(4\sin(x-3)\).
                        Thus, we were able to replace \(m(x)\) with \(4\sin(x-3)\) and we dropped the negative sign on the \(3\).
                        <br><br>
                        \(\text{c. }\) This part now asks us to look for the limit as \(x\) approaches \(3\) from the right. This would be visually represented
                        from the blue curve on the graph above. We see that the limit of \(m(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(3\) from the right is equal to \(-4\).
                        Following the same methodology from part \(b\), we can express this as the following:
                        \[
                            \begin{gather*}
                                \lim_{x\to 3^+} m(x) = \lim_{x\to 3} \left[(x-3)^2-4\right] = -4.
                            \end{gather*}
                        \]
                        \(\text{d. }\) Since this function is discontinuous, \(\lim_{x\to 3} m(x)\neq m(3)\). In fact, because the limit approaches different values
                        from each side, \(0\) from the left and \(-4\) from the right, the limit as \(x\) approaches \(3\) from both sides is <b>undefined</b>. 
                        This is because a limit must approach the same value from the left and the right, as stated before. We will go deeper into undefined limits
                        in the next section so don't worry about this one too much for now.
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    Provided that a limit exists, it may ease the evaluation if the function under cosideration is split into a sum, product, or quotient. The rules
                    for evaluating the original limit are as follows:
                    \[
                        \begin{align*}
                            & (a) \lim_{x\to\alpha} (f(x)+g(x)) = \lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)+\lim_{x\to\alpha} g(x) \\
                            & (b) \lim_{x\to\alpha} (f(x)g(x)) = \lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)\lim_{x\to\alpha} g(x) \\
                            & (c) \lim_{x\to\alpha} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to\alpha} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to\alpha} g(x)}.
                        \end{align*}
                    \]
                    A more extensive list of useful limit properties and formulae (including the ones
                    already mentioned) can be found <b><a class="lesson_links" href="../misc/Limit_Formulas.pdf">here</a></b>. These formulae can be very useful when solving more complicated limit problems.
                    <br><br>
                    In conclusion, when taking a limit of a function you are looking for the value the function approaches as the independent variable, in many cases \(x\),
                    approaches some value \(\alpha\), either from the left, right, or both sides simultaneously. In the following section we will go over discontinuities around
                    how to deal with infinity as a limit.
