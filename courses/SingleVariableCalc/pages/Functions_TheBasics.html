            <h3>Lesson 1: Functions and Limits</h3>
            <b>Functions: The Basics</b>
            <div>
                <p>
                    A <b>function</b> can be defined as the process of producing exactly
                    one answer for each input value. For example, the following set of ordered pairs
                    defines a function:
                    <br>
                    <p class="center_text">
                        \((1,2), (9,0), (8,3), (0,4), (5,7), (6,9), (3,3)\).
                    </p>
                    Note that it is not necessary for an input value, \(x\), to provide a unique output
                    value, \(f(x)\). From the ordered pairs above, you can see that the inputs \(8\) and \(3\) produce
                    an output value of \(3\). The opposite, however, is not true. That is, an input value must always
                    produce the <u>same</u> output value; i.e., the ordered pairs \((1,2)\) and \((1,4)\) cannot be true based on 
                    the function definition. Should these two ordered pairs exist, they define a <b>relation</b> and not
                    a function.
                    <br><br>
                    The set of input values of a function is called the <b>domain</b> and the set of output values from a
                    function are called the <b>range</b>. An <b>injection</b>, also known as an <b>injective function</b> or 
                    <b>one-to-one</b>, is a function that has a unique output value for each unique input value. A <b>surjection</b>,
                    also known as a <b>surjective function</b> or <b>onto</b>, is a function where every output value comes From
                    at least one input value. A <b>bijection</b> is a function that is both an injection and a surjection.
                    <br><br>
                    <img id="invert" class="bigFigure" src="../figures/Types_of_functions.png" alt="Images of the different types of fuctions">
                    <br><br>
                    From the image above:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The first diagram (furthest to the left) shows a relation, but not a function. This is because the input
                            value \(4\) has two different output values, \(5\) and \(8\).</li>
                        <li>
                            The second diagram shows a function that is not and injection or surjection. It is not an injection because
                            two unique input values, \(4\) and \(8\), lead to the same output value, \(9\). It is not a surjection because the ouput values
                            \(3\) and \(7\) do not have at least one input value that corresponds to them.
                        </li>
                        <li> 
                            The third diagram is that of an injective function that is not a surjective function simultaneously. It is not a
                            surjection because the output value \(0\) has no corresponding input value.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The fourth diagram shows a surjection that is not an injection. It is not an injective function because two output values,
                            \(2\) and \(6\), each have two corresponding input values, \(2\), \(8\), and \(6\), \(9\), respectively.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Lastly, the fifth diagram shows a bijection, a function that is injective and surjective.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    While we've introduced functions as sets, throughout the course we focus exclusively on functions whose rules can be written as equations.
                    Thus, a function is defined by an equation but a function is not the equation itself. No additional practice on functions will be given in Problem Set 1,
                    at the end of Lesson 1.
