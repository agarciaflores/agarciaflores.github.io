            <b>Evaluating Limits</b>
            <div>
                <p>
                    While we have gone over a few examples of limit problems, they have all involved a graph for us to visually solve the problem.
                    However, that will rarely be the case in an actual course. Thus, this section is dedicated to the different techniques one can
                    use to solve problems involving limits. The following techniques are the ones we feel are the most optimal and efficient. It is
                    a good idea to practice and master these techniques and their order, as starting with the first technique will be the most time
                    efficient. The techniques increase in difficulty as they go on as well, so it's best to see if one can solve a limit with simpler
                    techniques before moving on to the more challenging ones.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Direct Substitution</b>
                            <br>
                            The easiest method of solving limits is direct substitution. The name acurately describes the process, all you do is take
                            the value that you are approaching in the limit and plug it into the function. For example,
                            \[
                                \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{7x^3+14x^2+x}{2x^8+3x^4+2}.
                            \]
                            Direct substitution tells us to plug in the value of \(1\) for every \(x\). Doing so yields:
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{7x^3+14x^2+x}{2x^8+3x^4+2} &= \frac{7(1)^3+14(1)^2+(1)}{2(1)^8+3(1)^4+2} \\
                                    &= \frac{7+14+1}{2+3+2} \\
                                    &= \frac{22}{7}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            [Note that the limit notation is dropped after the direct substitution is done. Most students lose points on dropping the limit
                            notation too early, it's a good idea to keep track of where we drop the notation in the examples. Remember to keep the notation there
                            until the actual limit is evaluated.]
                            <br><br>
                            Direct substitution should always be the go-to method for evaluating limits. There are three main outcomes of direct substitution:
                            <br><br>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Getting a number value likely means you've got your answer.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Getting a fraction of \(\frac{\alpha}{0}\) where \(\alpha\) is not zero indicates the possibility of a discontinuity in the function
                                    at the \(x\) value the limit is approaching (probably a vertical asymptote). When this is the outcome, refer to the graph or table
                                    of the function. 
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Getting a fraction of \(\frac{0}{0}\) is an indeterminate form, meaning that nothing can be concluded from this result.
                                    When encountering this, try factorization, conjugates, rationalization, or trigonometric identities if they can be applied.
                                    [Other indeterminate forms involve inifinity, such as \(\infty-\infty\), \(\frac{\infty}{\infty}\), and more.]
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                            <br>
                            [The limit shown in this example could have been solved systematically using limit properties. Feel free to give it a gander if you're
                            curious.]

                                This limit problem can be solved systematically by taking advantage of a few limit properties. Particularly the quotient rule, sum 
                                rule, power rule, and constant function rule, listed below in this same order:
                                \[
                                    \begin{align*}
                                        & 1. \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to x_0} g(x)} \\
                                        & \text{provided that the numerator and denominator are not both equal to zero or infinity} \\
                                        & 2. \lim_{x\to x_0} \left[f_1(x)+f_2(x)+...+f_n(x)\right]  = \left[\lim_{x\to x_0} f_1(x)+ \lim_{x\to x_0}f_2(x)+...+ \lim_{x\to x_0} f_n(x) \right] \\
                                        & 3. \lim_{x\to x_0} [f(x)]^n = \left[\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)\right]^n \text{ where } n \in\mathbb{R} \\
                                        & 4. \lim_{x\to x_0} C = C \text{ where C is a constant.}
                                    \end{align*}
                                \]
                                Using the quotient rule, we let \(f(x) = 7x^3+14x^2+x\) and \(g(x) = 2x^8+3x^4+2\). Then, using the sum rule, we can split the \(f(x)\)
                                terms into their own limits, leaving us with \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[7x^3\right]\), \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[14x^2\right]\), and \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[x\right]\). Solving these limits
                                would result in \(7\), \(14\), and \(1\) respectively, using additional limit properties. Thus, \(\lim_{x\to 1}f(x) = 7+14+1 = 22\). Repeating this process for
                                \(g(x)\) would yield \(\lim_{x\to 1}g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1}\left[2x^8\right]+\lim_{x\to 1}\left[3x^4\right]+\lim_{x\to 1}\left[2\right] = 2+3+2 = 7\). Plugging these results back into the quotient
                                rule gives us our final answer:
                                \[
                                 \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to 1} g(x)} = \frac{22}{7}.
                                \]

                        <li>
                            <b>Factorization</b>
                            <br>
                            Given the following limit problem, the first attempt is done using direct substitution. However, we see that our result is indeterminate:
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x-1}{x^2+x-2} &= \frac{1-1}{1^2+1-2} \\
                                    &= \frac{0}{0}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            Notice that the denominator can be factored into linear terms: \(x^2+x-2\Rightarrow (x-1)(x+2)\). Making this substitution, and canceling out the common
                            factors, leaves us with
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                                \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x-1}{x^2+x-2} &= \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{x-1}{(x-1)(x+2)} \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{1}{x+2}.
                            \end{align*}
                            \]
                            Using direct substitution at this point yields the result:
                            \[
                            \begin{align*}
                                \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{1}{x+2} &= \frac{1}{1+2} \\
                                &= \frac{1}{3}.
                            \end{align*}
                            \]
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Infinite Limits</b>
                            <br>
                            The following problem is given to us:
                            \[
                                \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2x^4}{x+1}-2x
                            \]
                            This particular problem puts us in several difficult situations. For instance, this is the first problem we see where \(x\) approaches \(\infty\).
                            Infinity is more of a concept than it is a number, so direct substitution seems questionable here. When dealing with inifinity as a limit one should
                            look for the fastest growing term. At the basic level, the higher the exponent, the faster a term grows. So \(x^2\) "grows faster" than \(x\), yet "slower"
                            than \(x^3\). For polynomial terms, the exponent dictates how "fast" the term "grows." Logarithmic terms grow the slowest, and exponential terms grow the
                            fastest, faster than \(x^n\) no matter what real number \(n\) is.  [\(x^x\) is the fastest growing function but that typically isn't seen at this level.]
                            So the basic order is the following:
                            \[
                                \ln(x)\Rightarrow x,x^2,...,x^n \Rightarrow e^x
                            \]
                            [The words "grow," "faster," and "slower" are used to simplify the behavior of different types of functions.]
                            <br><br>
                            Trigonometric functions can be a bit trickier to predict. \(\sin\) and \(\cos\) only go as high as their amplitude, while all others go to \(\infty\) and
                            \(-\infty\) periodically.
                            <br><br>
                            Note that we <i>only</i> look at the fastest growing term in most cases. For example, in the problem \(\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^2+8x+3}{x^5-8x^4+3x^3+9x^2-x+12}\)
                            we focus only on the terms that grow the fastest from both the numerator and denominator, therefore the problem we're really looking at is \(\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^2}{x^5}\).
                            Since \(x^5\) grows faster than \(2x^2\), the denominator grows faster than the numerator and the whole term goes to \(0\). If the denominator grows faster,
                            the limit goes to \(0\), if the numerator grows faster, the limit goes to either \(+\infty\) or \(-\infty\), depending on the sign of the entire term. If
                            both the numerator and the denominator grow at the same rate, such as in the problem \(\lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{8x^2+3x+9}{10x^2-5x+6}\), then we look only
                            at the leading coefficients of the fastest growing terms, i.e.
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{8x^2+3x+9}{10x^2-5x+6} &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{8x^2}{10x^2} \\
                                    & \text{(Ignoring everything but the fastest growing terms)} \\
                                    &= \frac{8}{10} \\
                                    &= \frac{4}{5}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            The mathematical reasoning for this is we are essentially dividing every term by the term with the greatest exponent. We will walk through that process on
                            the initial problem, \(\lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2x^4}{x+1}-2x\). Before doing that, however, we must combine the entire problem into one fraction. We do that
                            by giving each term a common denominator, in this case all we have to do is multiply the second term, \(-2x\), by the denominator of the first term over itself,
                            \(\frac{x+1}{x+1}\), then simplify:
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4}{x+1}-2x &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4}{x+1}-(2x)\left(\frac{x+1}{x+1}\right) \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4}{x+1}-\frac{(2x)(x+1)}{x+1} \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4}{x+1}-\frac{2x^2+2x}{x+1} \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{(2x^4)-(2x^2+2x)}{x+1} \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4-2x^2-2x}{x+1}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            You may already be able to tell that the solution will be \(+\infty\) because the numerator grows faster than the denominator, since \(2x^4&gt;x\). However like
                            we stated earlier we want to show the reasoning behind why that methodology works. To do so, we divide every term from the numerator and denominator by the fastest
                            growing term, in this case \(x^4\) [note that we don't include the coefficient, just the independent variable and its exponent]:
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2x^4-2x^2-2x}{x+1} &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac{2x^4-2x^2-2x}{x^4}}{\frac{x+1}{x^4}} \\
                                    &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{\frac{2x^4}{x^4}-\frac{2x^2}{x^4}-\frac{2x}{x^4}}{\frac{x}{x^4}+\frac{1}{x^4}} \\
                                    &= \lim_{x\to\infty}\frac{2-\frac{2}{x^2}-\frac{2}{x^3}}{\frac{1}{x^3}+\frac{1}{x^4}}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            As we can see here, all of the terms that have an \(x\) in the denominator will tend to go to \(0\) as \(x\) goes to infinity. The only remaining term is the \(2\)
                            in the numerator. Thus, the numerator stays at the value \(2\) and the denominator goes to the value of \(0\) as \(x\to\infty\). When this happens, we say the limit
                            goes to infinity, since the denominator is getting infinitely small and the numerator is essentially constant. Think of it like the function \(\frac{1}{x}\), as \(x\)
                            approaches \(0\) from the right hand side the output values go to infinity. Thus, we conclude that
                            \[
                                \lim_{x\to\infty} \frac{2x^4}{x+1}-2x=\infty.
                            \]

                            <br>
                            If all else fails and the indeterminate form is inevitable, L'Hôspital's Rule is the last resort for solving limit problems. However, it requires knowledge of differentiation 
                            and differentiation techniques so it's not covered here. It is covered towards the end of Lesson 5.

                    That concludes the section on limits. More practice can be found in <a href="../problem_sets/ProblemSet1.pdf">Problem Set 1</a>, and the solutions to it found <a href="../problem_sets/ProblemSet1Solutions.pdf">here</a>. Most of the mathematical
                    understanding comes from the problem sets, while the lessons are mainly the theory. Additional resources on limits can be found below as well.
