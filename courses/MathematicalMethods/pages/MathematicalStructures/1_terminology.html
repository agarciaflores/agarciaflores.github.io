            <h3>Lesson 0: Mathematical Structures</h3>
            <b>An Introduction to Terminology</b>
            <div>
                <p>
                    I was lucky to take the Mathematical Structures course at ASU with <a href="https://math.la.asu.edu/~khroh/index.html">Dr. Kyeong-Hah Roh</a>, a brilliant mathematician and an even better lecturer.
                    The course introduces students to mathematical proofs via logic, set theory, induction, functions, order and equivalence relations, and cardinality.
                    We briefly go through most of these things in this section.
                    In this lesson, my aim is to elucidate to the reader the rationale behind my choice of vocabulary, the significance of such terminology, and the implications when encountering said terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A few common terms, and their definitions, as seen in <a href="../sources.html#duncan_dl">[1]</a>:
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Definition</b> - An explanation of the <i>mathematical</i> meaning of a word.</li></ol>
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Statement</b> - A sentence that can be either true or false, but not both simultaneously.</li></ol>
                    I realized I've given a definition to the word definition, but realize that we are not only giving an explanation of a word, but a mathematical explanation of the word.
                    This will soon make sense.
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Axiom</b> - A basic assumption about mathematical nature.</li></ol>
                    Think of axioms as the building blocks of mathematics.
                    These are things that come intuitively to even those not mathematically "advanced," such as the distrubitive property: for some numbers \(a, b, c\), the following property holds, \(a(b+c) = ab + ac\).
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Conjecture</b> - A statement proposed to be true (or, an unverified claim).</li></ol>
                    Naturally, mathematical statements start off as conjectures. As the statement is proven, it gains a new definition.
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Theorem</b> - A statement which has been proven to be true.</li></ol>
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Proof</b> - An explanation of the veracity of a statement.</li></ol>
                    In this course, we will be introuced to several theorems and prove them ourselves (as, by definition, we know a proof exists).
                    As we will soon see, there always exists more than one way to prove a theorem; although some techniques may be easier than others.
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Proposition</b> - A less significant yet intriguing true statement.</li></ol>
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Lemma</b> - A true statement that is utilized in proving other true statements, serving as a less significant theorem that aids in the proof of other findings.</li></ol>
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Corollary</b> - A true statement that is a trivial conclusion drawn from a theorem or proposition.</li></ol>
                    If the proof of a theorem is lengthy, some mathematicians may choose to prove a lemma prior to introducing the theorem, this way the proof of the lemma can be referenced in the proof of the theorem and thus shorten the proof's length.

                    <u><b id="math_symbols">[i] Mathematical Symbols</b></u>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Below are a few of the mathematical symbols that I will be using naturally in my writing, so I though it would be good to introduce them at the very beginning.
                    In other sections, like logic and set theory, for example, we will introduce additional symbols.
                    These give us a good starting ground:
                    <ol><li class="no-marker"><b>Predicate</b> - A predicate is a symbol that denotes a property or a relationship.</li></ol>
                    For example, in the first-order formula \(P(a)\), the symbol \(P\) represents a predicate that is applied on the individual constant \(a\). In the formula \(R(a,b)\), the symbol \(R\) represents a predicate that is applied to the individual constants \(a\) and \(b\).
                    <ol><li class="no-marker">\(\forall\) - Signifies universal quantification and is interpreted as "for all."</li> </ol>
                    If \(E\) is a logical predicate, \(\forall xE\) means that \(E\) is true for all possible values of the variable \(x\).
                    <ol><li class="no-marker">\(\exists\) - Signifies existential quantification and is interpreted as "there exists ... such that".</li> </ol>
                    If \(E\) is a logical predicate, \(\exists xE\) means that there exists at least one value of x for which E is true.
                    <ol><li class="no-marker">\(\Rightarrow\) - Represents material implication and is interpreted as "implies".</li></ol>
                    <ol><li class="no-marker">\(\Leftrightarrow\) - Symbolizes logical equivalence and is interpreted as "is equivalent to" or "if and only if".</li></ol>
