                    <h4>Section: Inifinity as a Limit, Undefined Limits, Continuity</h4>
                    A function is <b>continuous</b> bewteen a domain if the function is defined for all values of \(x\) within said domain
                    and if a small change in \(x\) does not produce a sudden jump in the value of the output, \(y\). For example, if the function
                    \(k(x)\) is defined for all \(x\) values between the interval \((-10,10)\) then the function is continuous over that same interval
                    (assuming there is no jump). If a function is not continuous at any \(x\), then we say the function has a <b>discontinuity</b> at
                    that value of \(x\). In essence, we say \(f(x)\) is continuous at \(x_0\) when
                    \[
                        \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0).
                    \]
                    <u><b>Theorem:</u> Differentiable Implies Continuous</b>
                    <br>
                    <i>If a function \(f\) is differentiable at \(x_0\), then \(f\) is continuous at \(x_0\).</i> [What is does it
                    mean to be differentiable? Come back to this after completing Lesson 3.]
                    <br><br>
                    <button id="button1" class="solutionButton">\(\rightarrow\) Proof</button>
                    <div id="text1" class="slideout">
                        [This proof assumes that you know and are comfortable with differentiation and its definition. If that is not the case, skip this for now.]
                        <br><br>
                        We start again with the statement from above:
                        \[
                            \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x) = f(x_0).
                        \]
                        If we move everything to the left then we see
                        \[
                            \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)-f(x_0) = 0.
                        \]
                        Thus, we are proving that the left hand side is equal to \(0\). We can start by multiplying the left hand side by \(\frac{x-x_0}{x-x_0}\) (Why? We are
                        essentially multiplying it by \(1\), since \(\frac{x-x_0}{x-x_0}\) has the same numerator and denominator, and therefore not changing its value).
                        Then, using some limit properties discussed previously, we can split the terms into two limits:
                        \[
                            \begin{align*}
                                \lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)-f(x_0) &= \lim_{x\to x_0} \frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}(x-x_0) \\
                                &= \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\lim_{x\to x_0}(x-x_0).
                            \end{align*}
                        \]
                        Finally, we recognize the first limit as the rate of change formula at \(f(x_0)\), \(f^{\prime}(x_0)\), and we evaluate the second limit to be \(0\). 
                        Therefore, regardless of what the first limit turns out to be, it will always be multiplied by \(0\) and thus make the whole thing equal to \(0\):
                        \[
                            \begin{align*}
                                &= \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x)-f(x_0)}{x-x_0}\lim_{x\to x_0}(x-x_0) \\
                                &= f^{\prime}(x_0)\cdot 0 \\
                                &= 0.
                            \end{align*}
                        \]
                        To summarize, the function \(f\) being differentiable at \(x_0\) was our hypothesis of the theorem and \(f\) being continuous at \(x_0\) (the statement we started from)
                        was our conclusion of the theorem. Additionally, when we multiply by \(\frac{x-x_0}{x-x_0}\) it looks like we are multiplying and dividing by \(0\), exactly the thing that
                        makes all proofs wrong (multiplying and dividing by \(0\) is commonly used to "prove" statements which are not true, so multiplying and dividing by \(0\) in a proof is wrong).
                        However, limits are able to get around this since the second limit, \(\lim_{x\to x_0}(x-x_0)\), is always approaching \(0\) but is never actually 0. In other words, \(x\neq x_0\).
                        In fact, \(x=x_0\) is exactly the one value of \(x\) that we don't consider in this limit. Thus, technically, the limit is always very small but never actually \(0\).
                        <br><br>
                        [This proof shows that if a function is differentiable then it is also continuous. That does not necessarily imply that if the function is not differentiable then it is also not continuous.
                        In essence, a function can be continuous and without being differentiable. Take the absolute value function for example, \(\lvert x\rvert\). Though it is not differentiable at \(x=0\), it is still
                        continuous. The function being differentiable is a <i>sufficient condition</i> for continuity, not a <i>necessary condition</i>. This theorem does however imply that if a function \(f(x)\) is 
                        discontinuous at \(x=\alpha\) then \(f(x)\) is not differentiable at \(x=\alpha\).]

                    <br>
                    To conclude the continuity section, there are four types of discontinuities that one should be aware of:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Removable Discontinuity</b>
                            <br>
                            A removable discontinuity is when a function is continuous everywhere but one value of \(x\). Take, for example, the function \(\frac{\sin(x)}{x}\), which is defined for \(x\neq 0\):
                            <br><br>
                            <img class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure1.png" alt="A graph of the function sin(x)/x">
                            <br>
                            In essence, if \(\lim_{x\to x_0^+} f(x) = \lim_{x\to x_0^-} f(x)\) but is not equal to \(f(x_0)\), or if \(f(x_0)\) is undefined, we call the discontinuity <b>removable</b>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Jump Discontinuity</b>
                            <br>
                            Jump disoncontinuities occur when the limits from both sides of a particular \(x\) value approach two different values, i.e. \(\lim_{x\to x_0^+}f(x)\neq\lim_{x\to x_0^-} f(x)\).
                            For example, let's look at the graph of the piecewise function \(p\), defined by:
                            \[
                                \begin{gather*}
                                    p(x) = \left\{
                                        \begin{array}{11}
                                            (x+1)(x-1) & x&lt;0 \\
                                            4x+1 & x&gt;0 
                                        \end{array}
                                        \right.
                                \end{gather*}
                            \]
                            <img class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure2.png" alt="A graph of the piecewise function p(x).">
                            <br>
                            From the graph, we can see that \(p(x)\) approaches different values from the left and right of \(x=0\). Thus, \(p(x)\) has a <b>jump discontinuity</b> at \(x=0\).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Infinite Discontinuity</b>
                            <br>
                            An infinite discontinuity is when a function approaches infinity in the y-direction, this is the behavior that is seen in vertical asymptotes. An example of an
                            infinite discontinuity is the fuction \(\frac{1}{x}\) at \(x=0\):
                            <img class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure3.png" alt="A graph of the function 1/x showing the verical asymptote at x=0.">
                            <br>
                            The right-hand limit as \(x\) approaches \(0\) is equal to positive infinity, \(\lim_{x\to 0^+}\frac{1}{x}=\infty\), and the left-hand limit as \(x\) approaches
                            \(0\) is equal to negative infinity, \(\lim_{x\to 0^-}\frac{1}{x}=-\infty\).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Essential Discontinuities</b>
                            <br>
                            An essential disoncontinuity is one which doesn't fit any of the previous three types. There are several examples out there but the one mentioned here is the limit of \(\sin(\frac{1}{x})\)
                            as \(x\) approaches \(0\), \(\lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\frac{1}{x})\). The graph of \(\sin(\frac{1}{x})\) is the following:
                            <img class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure4.png" alt="A graph of the function sin(1/x), showing how ugly it becomes at the origin, x=0.">
                            <br>
                            This function oscillates a lot as it approaches the origin, as is the case with other functions as well. For cases like this, it doesn't make sense to say the function
                            goes to anything; not even \(\pm\infty\). Thus, we say the limit does not exist.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h4>Section: Trigonometric Limits</h4>
                    Briefly, we felt it would be useful to go over the proof for two popular trigonometric limits. Particularly,
                    \[
                        \begin{gather*}
                            \lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} = 1; & \lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{\theta} = 0.
                        \end{gather*}
                    \]
                    We will be using a geomtric proof for both. We start off with a circle with a radius of \(1\). Note that the angle \(\theta\) in this case is in radians and not degrees.
                    The formula for the arc length of a circle is \(s=r\theta\), since \(r=1\), \(s=\theta\). Additionally, recall that the \(\sin\) of the angle \(\theta\) is equal to the quotient
                    of the side opposite the angle and the radius. Since \(r=1\), the side opposite the angle \(\theta\) is equal to \(\sin(\theta)\):
                    <img id="invert" class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure5.png" alt="A picture of a circle with radius 1." style="width: 30%;">
                    <br>
                    The first limit has \(\theta\) going to \(0\), thus we zoom into the circle and start decreasing the angle:
                    <img id="invert" class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure6.png" alt="A zoom in on the circle from the previous figure, showing the angle decreasing." style="width: 40%;">
                    <br>
                    The main idea here is that as \(\theta\) decreases, goes to \(0\), \(\sin(\theta)=s=\theta\). This is a small angle approximation. Thus, \(\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta}=1\) and
                    \(\lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} = 1\).
                    <br><br>
                    Moving on to the second limit, the one involving the \(\cos\), we start off again with the same circle of radius \(1\) and labeling the arc length of the angle \(\theta\). However,
                    because we are now involving a \(\cos\) we label the adjacent side to the angle \(\theta\) instead of the opposite. We label the side \(\cos(\theta)\). Note that because the length of
                    the radius is \(1\), the remaining length of the radius along the adjacent side of the angle would be \(1-\cos(\theta)\):
                    <img id="invert" class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure7.png" alt="A figure of a circle with radius 1, labeling the arc length and the adjacent side." style="width: 30%;">
                    <br>
                    If we zoom in we can see that as the angle \(\theta\) decreases the remaining length of the radius, the length of \(1-\cos(\theta)\), decreases as well:
                    <img id="invert" class="figure" src="UndefinedLimits_Figure8.png" alt="A close up of the previous figure, showing the specified length decreases as the angle decreases." style="width: 40%;">
                    <br>
                    Thus, as \(\theta\) decreases, \(1-\cos(\theta)\) goes to \(0\) and, by extension, \(\lim_{\theta\to 0}\frac{1-\cos(\theta)}{\theta} = 0\), because the numerator goes to the \(0\),
                    it makes the whole thing go to \(0\). You may be thinking that "plugging in \(0\)" would make the whole term equal to \(\frac{0}{0}\), an undeterminant form. However, \(\theta\neq 0\)
                    in this proof, it only <i>approaches</i> it.
                    <br><br>
                    That brings us to the end of the theory behind limits and a few proofs. In the next section we will go over limit problems and how the different techniques used to evaluate them.
