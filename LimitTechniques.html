            <b>Evaluating Limits</b>

                    While we have gone over a few examples of limit problems, they have all involved a graph for us to visually solve the problem.
                    However, that will rarely be the case in an actual course. Thus, this section is dedicated to the different techniques one can
                    use to solve problems involving limits. The following techniques are the ones we feel are the most optimal and efficient. It is
                    a good idea to practice and master these techniques and their order, as starting with the first technique will be the most time
                    efficient. The techniques increase in difficulty as they go on as well, so it's best to see if one can solve a limit with simpler
                    techniques before moving on to the more challenging ones.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>Direct Substitution</b>
                            <br>
                            The easiest method of solving limits is direct substitution. The name acurately describes the process, all you do is take
                            the value that you are approaching in the limit and plug it into the function. For example,
                            \[
                                \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{7x^3+14x^2+x}{2x^8+3x^4+2}.
                            \]
                            Direct substitution tells us to plug in the value of \(1\) for every \(x\). Doing so yields:
                            \[
                                \begin{align*}
                                    \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{7x^3+14x^2+x}{2x^8+3x^4+2} &= \frac{7(1)^3+14(1)^2+(1)}{2(1)^8+3(1)^4+2} \\
                                    &= \frac{7+14+1}{2+3+2} \\
                                    &= \frac{22}{7}.
                                \end{align*}
                            \]
                            [Note that the limit notation is dropped after the direct substitution is done. Most students lose points on dropping the limit
                            notation too early, it's a good idea to keep track of where we drop the notation in the examples.]
                            <br><br>
                            After gaining enough experience with algebra, it becomes second nature knowing when direct substitution would work. If it results in
                            an indeterminant result, like \(\frac{0}{0}\), then moving on to the next technique is the best idea.
                            <br><br>
                            The limit shown in this example could have been solved systematically using limit properties. Feel free to give it a gander if you're
                            curious.

                                This limit problem can be solved systematically by taking advantage of a few limit properties. Particularly the quotient rule, sum 
                                rule, power rule, and constant function rule, listed below in this same order:
                                \[
                                    \begin{align*}
                                        & 1. \lim_{x\to x_0}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to x_0} g(x)} \\
                                        & \text{provided that the numerator and denominator are not both equal to zero or infinity} \\
                                        & 2. \lim_{x\to x_0} \left[f_1(x)+f_2(x)+...+f_n(x)\right]  = \left[\lim_{x\to x_0} f_1(x)+ \lim_{x\to x_0}f_2(x)+...+ \lim_{x\to x_0} f_n(x) \right] \\
                                        & 3. \lim_{x\to x_0} [f(x)]^n = \left[\lim_{x\to x_0} f(x)\right]^n \text{ where } n \in\mathbb{R} \\
                                        & 4. \lim_{x\to x_0} C = C \text{ where C is a constant.}
                                    \end{align*}
                                \]
                                Using the quotient rule, we let \(f(x) = 7x^3+14x^2+x\) and \(g(x) = 2x^8+3x^4+2\). Then, using the sum rule, we can split the \(f(x)\)
                                terms into their own limits, leaving us with \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[7x^3\right]\), \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[14x^2\right]\), and \(\lim_{x\to 1}\left[x\right]\). Solving these limits
                                would result in \(7\), \(14\), and \(1\) respectively, using additional limit properties. Thus, \(f(x) = 7+14+1\). Repeating this process for
                                \(g(x)\) would yield \(g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1}\left[2x^8\right]+\lim_{x\to 1}\left[3x^4\right]+\lim_{x\to 1}\left[2\right] = 2+3+2 = 7\). Plugging these results back into the quotient
                                rule gives us our final answer:
                                \[
                                 \lim_{x\to 1}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to 1} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to 1} g(x)} = \frac{22}{7}.
                                \]
