    "\n",
    "Two friends, Alice and Bob, just got into the business of selling apples. The thing is, their apple orchard is half an hour, by foot, from the nearest town: the town of Quantica. The people of Quantica love Alice and Bob's apples, and are constantly making purchases online. Since Alice and Bob just got into the business, they lack proper equipment for apple transportation. At the moment, their best idea is to have Alice stay at the orchard and pick the apples from the apple trees, while Bob travels by foot to Quantica to deliver the apples. Bob has a bin of dimensions $1\\times M$ apples, so he can carry at most $M$ apples per trip.\n",
    "\n",
    "<figure>\n",
    "    <img class=\"figure\" src=\"../ipynb/2024-04-20/bin.png\" alt=\"An image of Bob's bin to carry apples.\">\n",
    "    <figcaption><b>Figure 1.</b> A view of the bin Bob uses to carry apples. We see the first four and the last two apples, with the ellipsis indicating additional apples in between.</figcaption>\n",
    "</figure>\n",
    "\n",
    "For some reason, Alice and Bob came up with a rule for the people purchasing their apples: the amount of apples a customer buys must be exactly one more than the previous customer, with the counter reseting at the end of the day. So, if the first customer of the day purchases $n$ apples, then the next person must purchase exactly $n+1$ apples, and the next person must purchase exactly $n+2$ apples, and so on. The people of Quantica thought this was a strange rule to implement, but continued to purchase apples nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, apples have a very short shelf life. As a result, Alice and Bob have a limit on the maximum number of apples a person can order, call it $m$, with $n \\leq m < M$. That is, once a person places an order for $m$ apples, no additional orders can be placed for the remainder of the day. This limit is met daily due to demand from the people of Quantica. So, on any given day Alice and Bob receive orders for $n$, $n+1$, $n+2$, $\\ldots$, $m-1$, and $m$ apples -- as $n$ progresses up to $m$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob's apples are so popular that all of the orders come in almost instantly at the beginning of the day. At first, Bob was walking the orders one by one: first walking to Quantica to take the order with $n$ apples, coming back to the apple orchard, then taking the order with $n+1$ apples, and repeating this process until the last order with $m$ apples. This thing is, this process would result it $m-n+1$ trips to Quantica. That's $m-n+1$ hours!\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob thought this was way too much time and have been wanting to talk to someone about their problem. Specifically, they want to know, <u>is there a way to plan their deliveries so that the number of trips Bob makes to Quantica is minimized?</u> Knowing the problem solvers that we are, Alice and Bob have come to us with their problem. How can we help them?"
