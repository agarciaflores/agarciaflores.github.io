    "Since Alice and Bob just got into the business, they lack proper equipment for apple transportation.\n",
    "At the moment, their best idea is to have Alice stay at the orchard and pick the apples from the apple trees, while Bob travels by foot to Quantica to deliver the apples.\n",
    "Bob has a bin of dimensions $1\\times M$ apples, so he can carry at most $M$ apples per trip.\n",

    "For some reason, Alice and Bob came up with a rule for the people purchasing their apples: the amount of apples a customer buys must be exactly one more than the previous customer, with the counter reseting at the end of the day.\n",
    "So, if the first customer of the day purchases $n$ apples (obviously, $n > 0$), then the next person must purchase exactly $n+1$ apples, and the next person must purchase exactly $n+2$ apples, and so on.\n",
    "The people of Quantica thought this was a strange rule to implement, but continued to purchase apples nonetheless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, apples have a very short shelf life.\n",
    "As a result, Alice and Bob have a limit on the maximum number of apples a person can order, call it $m$, with $n \\leq m < M$.\n",
    "That is, once a person places an order for $m$ apples, no additional orders can be placed for the remainder of the day.\n",
    "This limit is met daily due to demand from the people of Quantica.\n",

    "\n",
    "Alice and Bob's apples are so popular that all of the orders come in almost instantly at the beginning of the day.\n",
    "At first, Bob was walking the orders one by one: first walking to Quantica to take the order with $n$ apples, coming back to the apple orchard, then taking the order with $n+1$ apples, and repeating this process until the last order with $m$ apples.\n",

    "In words, we start with the biggest order, of size $m$, and decrement order size by one until we reach an order, of size $\\sigma +1$ which will push us over the threshold of $M$.\n",
